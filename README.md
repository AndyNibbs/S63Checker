# S63Checker
A tool to check that an S-63 exchange set is properly signed

This tool is open-source under the permission MIT licence so that anyone in the industry can take it up and get involved.

The idea occurred to me during a CIRM ECDIS working group meeting where we were discussing possible extensions to the signing of S-63 chart exchange sets. 

If the range of files was extended then type approved ECDIS navigation systems would inevitably lag behind the availablility of signed datasets. The mariner would have no way to check a dataset. This tool can fill that gap. 

More realistically it can be useful in ensuring that exchanges sets are correctly produced by data producers and the verification of exchange sets properly carried out by ECDIS kernel implementers. A solid point so that everything is not built on shifting sands. A line in the sand. 

That's the plan. Or maybe it will end up as another failed open-source project. 

I work for CHERSOFT and I am developing this with their blessing but this is not a CHERSOFT project.
