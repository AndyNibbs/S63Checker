# S63Checker
A tool to check that an S-63 exchange set is properly signed. 

Now includes checking for the proposed S63_SIGNATURES.XML file addition. 

The idea occurred to me during a CIRM ECDIS working group meeting where we were discussing possible extensions to the signing of S-63 chart exchange sets. 
- Could develop into ways for a mariner to check a dataset ahead of their ECDIS checking it.
- Could help in the creation of valid datasets.
- Can help highlight strengths and weaknesses of proposed change.
