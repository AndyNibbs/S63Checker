# Make it open source

- Can we have github build it? so that people can download built version
- Improve readme page to clarify everything

# Better checking

In the wider interests of cyber-security transmittals could be rejected for containing certain red-flag file extensions. 

There's no reason for an exchange set to contain executable code so .exe, .dll, .ocx - that sort of thing is worrying. 

Also a whitelist approach to be had:

Cell and sig extensions .000, .001, ... 999.
Aux .txt, .tif, .tiff, .png, .jpg?
s63_Signatures.xml
CATALOG.031
.pdf - I expect
and so on.

Warn user of these things. 

Maybe, opportunity to throw AV at the exchange set.  https://github.com/yolofy/AvScan
